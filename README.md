Go Implementation and Example Client for the BitMessage Protocol.

I created this project out of personal interest in how the BitMessage protocol and the Go Programming Language work. If it becomes useful, feel free to use it in your own project. If not, oh well, I wasn't expecting much.


About BitMessage
==
Bitmessage is a P2P communications protocol used to send encrypted messages to another person or to many subscribers. It is decentralized and trustless, meaning that you need-not inherently trust any entities like root certificate authorities. It uses strong authentication which means that the sender of a message cannot be spoofed, and it aims to hide "non-content" data, like the sender and receiver of messages, from passive eavesdroppers like those running warrantless wiretapping programs.
